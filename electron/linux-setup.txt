GMK87 Configurator - Linux Setup
=================================

If you get a "Failed to open HID device" or "cannot open device" error,
your system needs a udev rule to allow access to the keyboard without root.

Run these commands:

    sudo cp 50-gmk87.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger

Then replug your keyboard.

If you installed the .deb package, this was done automatically.
